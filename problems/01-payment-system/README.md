## Problem: Payment Processing System

We need to design a system that can process different types of payments.

### Supported Payments (Initial Version)

* Credit Card
* Debit Card
* UPI

### Requirements

1. A user should be able to make a payment using any method.
2. The system should print confirmation of the payment.
3. In future, we must support new payment types like:

   * Wallet
   * NetBanking
   * Crypto
4. Adding new payment types should NOT break existing code.

### Goal

Design this system using SOLID principles so it is easy to extend.
